/* WHERE & IN operator
Shortcut to using multiple OR conditions
referencing different values in the same column. 

SELECT 
	customer_id, 
    rental_id, 
    amount, 
    payment_date
FROM payment
WHERE amount > 5
	OR customer_id = 42
    OR customer_id = 53
    OR customer_id = 60
    OR customer_id = 75

# Using WHERE & IN produces the exact result using less OR conditions and faster. 

SELECT 
	customer_id, 
    rental_id, 
    amount, 
    payment_date
FROM payment
WHERE customer_id IN(5, 11, 29) # query is faster than above
