/* CASE Statement
- Process a series of IF/THEN logical operators in specific order. 
- Uses conditional logic to specify how results should be calculated. 
- Most common application is to bucket values. 

Ex: 
	CASE WHEN logic1 THEN value1 WHEN logic2 THEN value2 ELSE(optional) value3 END
	Every CASE statement begins with CASE, ends with END, and contains at least one THEN/WHEN pair.
	   	
Ex: 
CASE                                                        
	WHEN category IN('horror', 'suspense')THEN 'too scary'
    WHEN lenght > 90 THEN 'too long'
    ELSE 'we should see it'
END

!! CASE stateemnts execute in order they appear. Left to right, top to bottom. 
Fullfill until one criteria is met. 

ELSE condition used as a catch all. 

ex: 
SELECT DISTINCT
	length, 
    CASE 
		WHEN length < 60 THEN 'under 1hr'
        WHEN length BETWEEN 60 AND 90 THEN '1-1.5hrs'
        WHEN length > 90 THEN 'over 1.5hrs'
        ELSE 'error, check code'
	END AS lenght_bucket
