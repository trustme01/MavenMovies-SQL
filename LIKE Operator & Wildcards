/* LIKE, NOT LIKE Operator & WILDCARDS
Pattern matching  in logical operators, 
instead of exact matching.

column LIKE '%pattern%' (TRUE, any characters match, before or after)
column LIKE 'pattern_' (TRUE, first character matches, regardless if followed)
column LIKE '_pattern' (TRUE, last character matches, regardless if preceded)
