/* LIKE Operator
Used for pattern matching for logical operators 
(instead of the exact meaning). 

LIKE %pattern_to_look_for%

Ex: 
WHERE name LIKE 'Denise%' 		 = starts with 'Denise,' any char after
WHERE description LIKE '%fancy%' = contains 'fancy,' any char before/ after
WHERE name LIKE '%Johnson'		 = records end with 'Johnson,' any char before
WHERE first_name LIKE '_erry' 	 = end with 'erry,' exactly one char before

NOT LIKE: filters out records, use same wildcards and capitalization.

	title, 
    description
